  introMessage: >
    Instead of a generic resume site which would only serve to replicate [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-broderick-4j4/), 
    this site is dedicated to tracking all my services, servers, and projects. Feel free to take a look around. Send an email to [roles@daniel-broderick.com](mailto:roles@daniel-broderick.com) 
    if you'd like to offer me a job; open to full-time, contract, or freelance opportunities.

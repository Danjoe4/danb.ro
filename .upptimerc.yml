  introTitle: "Welcome to my website."
  introMessage: Instead of a generic resume site which would only serve to replicate [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-broderick-4j4/), this site is dedicated to tracking all my services, servers, and projects. Feel free to take a look around. Send an email to <roles@daniel-broderick.com> if you'd like to offer me a job; open to full-time, contract, or freelance opportunities.

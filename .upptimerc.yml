  introTitle: "Welcome to my website."
  introMessage: >
    Instead of a generic resume site which would only serve to replicate [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-brod/), 
    this site is dedicated to tracking all my services, servers, and projects. Most of which are self hosted on [this machine](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/thinkcentre-m720q/11tc1mtm72q).
    Feel free to take a look around. Send an email to [roles@danb.ro](mailto:roles@danb.ro) 
    if you'd like to offer me a job; open to full-time, contract, or freelance opportunities.
